Libfreesoccer - Library written in Haskell for Freekick,
a soccer game.

Installation (using Cabal):

1. Decompress in a directory of your choice, e.g.:
 $ tar xvzf libfreekick-0.0.1.tar.gz
2. Change to decompressed directory:
 $ cd libfreekick-0.0.1
3. Configure, build and install using Cabal, e.g.:
 $ runhaskell Setup.hs configure --user --prefix=$HOME
 $ runhaskell Setup.hs build
 $ runhaskell Setup.hs install
4. Done!

Note that you need libaddutil for libfreesoccer to work.
You should find that at http://finder.homelinux.org/freekick/.
For a simplified build process use the buildall script available from the
darcs repository: darcs get http://finder.homelinux.org/darcs/Freekick
