Freekick - a soccer game written in Haskell.

Installation (using Cabal):

1. Decompress in a directory of your choice, e.g.:
 $ tar xvzf freekick-0.0.1.tar.gz
2. Change to decompressed directory:
 $ cd freekick-0.0.1
3. Configure, build and install using Cabal, e.g.:
 $ runhaskell Setup.hs configure --user --prefix=$HOME
 $ runhaskell Setup.hs build
 $ runhaskell Setup.hs install
4. Done!

Note that you need libaddutil and libfreesoccer for Freekick.
You should find them at http://finder.homelinux.org/freekick/.
For a simplified build process use the buildall script available from the
darcs repository: darcs get http://finder.homelinux.org/darcs/Freekick

Usage:
Freekick currently provides four executable files:
1. freekickmenu - used for creating matchdata files
2. physics - the match server
3. ai - match ai
4. fksdl - an SDL client

To start a game you need a matchdata file. These are generated with
freekickmenu by choosing a friendly match and inputting the clubs, e.g.
"MK Dons" and "Wrexham" (without quotes). One matchdata file should be
included with the distribution as matchdata.md. For creating matchdata files
the database (the DB directory under data in the repository) should be copied 
into your $HOME/.freekick directory, so it's probably easier to just use the
given matchdata.md file.
The matchdata file is created by freekickmenu as /tmp/matchdata.md and the 
path to it has to be given to the match server as parameter, which should be 
started next. After that the ai as well as a client should be started. So in 
a nutshell, the process is:

$ physics /tmp/matchdata.md  # leave this open in a terminal
$ ai                         # leave this open in another terminal
$ fksdl

If you need to create a matchdata file, you can do that with freekickmenu:

$ freekickmenu               # create a friendly match
