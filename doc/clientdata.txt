Client data file:
reservations:

pl "test1" (pw "secret1") has id 1234
pl "test2" (pw "secret2") has id 3456
...

in client data file:
lists of who plays as whom
client username/password hash lists
min/max number of human players

server behavior:
for "casual"/single player matches/matches on public servers:
- client authenticates itself on the server: just allow everyone
- anyone can play as anybody
  - client(s) simply say which player they control
- start game when clients are ready

for "league" matches:
- soccer player with id x is only allowed to be controlled by player named "xx"/ai
- client authenticates itself on the server: server has username/password lists
- at least/maximum xx human players are expected before start

-> human player account for each soccer player
-> soccer players without account are ai
-> human player account: name, password (hash), player id
-> client sends name, pw, id, server verifies
