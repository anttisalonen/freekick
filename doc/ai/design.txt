1. There are Tasks
2. Tasks can be given in 3 ways:
   1. external source
   2. a Task is divided into a Partial Task by:
   2.a. by pattern/definition (preprogrammed)
   2.b. Partial Task(s) are created depending on the Environment (Environment Dependent Tasks)
        (Environment Dependencies)
3. A Partial Task is a Task
4. a Task can have logical conditions that define when the Task is accomplished
   (Fulfillment Requirements)
5. Tasks can be deleted in 4 ways:
   1. external "delete message"
   2. fulfilling the Fulfillment Requirements (if any)
   3. when Environment Dependencies are not valid anymore
   4. deletion of parent Task
6. Tasks are saved in a List or a Priority Queue
7. the Resource for fulfilling a Task is separated from the logic
8. Atomic Tasks cannot be split anymore and are the smallest tasks
9. Atomic Tasks are fulfilled by the Resource
