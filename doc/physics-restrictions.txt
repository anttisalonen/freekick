Restrictions:
- general match status
  - pitch type
  - player status
    - fatique
    - injury status
  - player skills
    - stamina (all physical activities)
    - dexterity (acceleration, jumping, fast ball actions)
    - speed (running)
    - tackling
    - passing (passing power & accuracy)
    - shooting (shooting power)
    - control (?)
    - accuracy (shooting accuracy)
    - goalkeeping
    - heading
- physics engine
  - gravity
  - weather
    - air attributes
    - pitch

Restrictable things:
- run velocity
  - affected by gravity, player skills (stamina, speed), fatigue, weather, pitch
- jump velocity
  - affected by gravity, player skills (stamina, heading), fatigue, weather, pitch
- kick velocity
  - affected by player skills, fatigue, weather, pitch
- kick accuracy
- tackle velocity
- goalkeeper actions
- setting controlled status bits

Finding 1: physics engine has settings that affect gravity and weather (air, pitch)
Finding 2: a class after Listener, before Physics (Monitor) corrects and drops client input before passing it to physics
Finding 3: Monitor also handles acceleration by saving the velocity setpoint and regularly sending Physics velocities that near the setpoint
