Notes:
1. Inside <kickoffs/> tag, the kickoff tournament has form of standard tournament
2. there can be two kickoffs, one for both directions
3. positions of clubs that participate in kickoffs is inferred from the number of clubs promoted/relegated
4. clubs not promoted/relegated via kickoffs are promoted/relegated via league
5. checking needs to be done to ensure not too many clubs are promoted/relegated (kickoffs exchanged > leaguepr num)
6. it also needs be to checked that the total number of relegated clubs in all branches of the upper level
   matches the total number of promoted clubs in all branches of the lower level
7. stages themselves have no information on how many clubs are promoted/relegated, but only the branch
