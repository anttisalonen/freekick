Freekick - a soccer game written in Haskell.

This is the README file for the darcs repository of freekick. You can simply
compile and install freekick and the necessary libraries using the script
buildall:

 $ ./buildall

This will install freekick to $HOME/freekick using Cabal. If you want to
tweak the installation (as in change the installation directory), feel free
to modify the script as necessary. You also need the other libraries, e.g. 
Hexpat and the SDL bindings. Cabal will let you know what you're missing.

For information on using and starting freekick, see the README file in the
freekick subdirectory.
